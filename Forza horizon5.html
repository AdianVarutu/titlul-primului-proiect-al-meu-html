<p style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma "><span class="important">Forza Horizon 5 </span>is a 2021 racing video game developed by Playground Games and published by Xbox Game Studios. It is the fifth Forza Horizon title and twelfth main instalment in the Forza series. The game is set in a fictionalised representation of Mexico. It was released on 9 November 2021 for Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.<br>

 <div class="proprietateparagraf">  The game received critical acclaim and became a commercial success upon release; it launched to over ten million players in the first week, the biggest-ever launch for an Xbox Game Studios game. The game won three jury-voted awards at The Game Awards 2021, tying with Hazelight's It Takes Two for most wins, and was also nominated for the public-voted Players' Voice award, which went to fellow Xbox Game Studios title Halo Infinite.</div></p>
